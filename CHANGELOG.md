# B2R2 Change Log

## 0.6.0 (2022-06-29)

### Added
- More instruction supports for MIPS
- More instruction supports for Intel
- Added initial support for WASM (thanks to @kimdora)
- Added several more classes in the Core module

### Changed
- Now we use .NET 6 (and F# 6). Our framework is not compatible with .NET 5.
- Fixed MIPS exception frame parser
- Optimized ELF parser for loading callsite tables
- Fixed several bugs in Intel assembler
- Changed ConcEval's interface
- We now avoid using non-standard register sizes, such as `2<rt>` and `3<rt>`;
  we only use sizes multiple of 8 (e.g., 8, 16, 32, 64) or size 1. For those
  register variables whose size is non-standard, e.g., `FTOP` in Intel, we
  assign larger size for the variable.
- Fixed several bugs in Intel and MIPS lifters
- Fixed several bugs in BinFile module (ELF and PE)
- Fixed several bugs in the middle-end (such as tail-call detection logic, etc.)

## 0.5.0 (2021-10-22)

### Added
- Handle ELF exception frames
- Introduce new CFG recovery engine
- Introduce `BinaryPointer` type which allows accessing non-addressable region
  of binary
- Add few more instruction support for x86-64 and ARMv7
- Add a RearEnd.Launcher, which is a .NET CLI tool. You can now install B2R2 by
  typing `dotnet tool install -g B2R2.RearEnd.Launcher`
- Add support for AVR architecture

### Changed
- MiddleEnd has been largely rewritten
- Module and function names largely changed
- Hash-consing is now controlled with build macro `HASHCONS`
- MiddleEnd.ConcEval works with base address changes
- Local IR optimizer has been rewritten
- Optimized data-flow engine

## 0.4.0 (2020-05-02)

### Added
- Add support for Mach-O relocation.
- Add support for COFF object parsing.
- Add support for floating-point operations.
- Add several missing Intel instructions.
- Add a basic dataflow framework.
- Add a partial support for Intel assembler. We will fully implement Intel
  assembler in the next version.

### Changed
- Fix various liting/parsing bugs.
- Fix dominator algorithm bug.
- Fix various BinGraph bugs.
- Improve Web UI performance.
- Fix a zooming bug in the Web UI.
- Update OptParse version.
- Remove manually-encoded Intel constants, which will slightly slow down our
  front-end, but it will improve the maintanence cost.
- Clean up the REPL app, and make it more generic for future use.
- Split MiddleEnd from BinGraph.

## 0.3.1 (2020-01-11)

### Added
- Add boilerplate code for assembler.
- Add Nil to LowUIR to correctly handle cons cells.
- Handle delayed import directory table for PE files.
- Add basic EVM bytecode support.

### Changed
- Fix and refactor simple calculator language implementation.
- Fix Mach section parsing bug.
- Fix ARM translation errors.
- Remove assumption about callee names.
- Fix bitectors to generally handle arbitrary sizes.
- Fix several visualization issues.
- Rewrite completely the web user interface from scratch.

## 0.3.0 (2019-09-28)

### Added
- Add a demangler module for both Itanium and MS types.
- Add `GetNextAddrs` method to `Instruction` type.
- Add several CFG-related lenses to smoothly transform a certain graph into
  another form.
- Start supporting ARMv7 SIMD instructions.
- Add a simple REPL for LowUIR.
- Add a simple calculator language for BinExplorer.

### Changed
- Fix ARMv7 translation errors (close to stable now).
- Fix subtle errors in ELF parsing (GitHub issue #25)
- Fix visualization bugs.
- Redesign many parts in BinGraph modules and their APIs.
- Fix graph building logic to handle ARM/Thumb switching.
- Refactor WebUI modules.
- Update disassembly modules to be able to decompose assembly statements into
  pieces.

## 0.2.1 (2019-07-21)

### Added
- Add a draggable handle between WebUI panes.

### Changed
