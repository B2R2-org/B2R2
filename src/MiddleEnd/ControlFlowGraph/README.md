# B2R2.MiddleEnd.ControlFlowGraph

### B2R2?

B2R2 is a binary analysis and reversing framework written purely in F#. Since it
does not rely on any native (unmanaged) code, it is readily usable in any
platform or OS that .NET runs on.

### B2R2.MiddleEnd.ControlFlowGraph Package?

`B2R2.MiddleEnd.ControlFlowGraph` defines CFG-related types and functions. While
`B2R2.MiddleEnd.BinGraph` defines low-level graph data structures and functions,
this package provides more specific implementation.
