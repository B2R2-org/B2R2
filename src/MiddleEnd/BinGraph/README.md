B2R2 is a binary analysis and reversing framework written purely in F#. Since it
does not rely on any native (unmanaged) code, it is readily usable in any
platform or OS that .NET runs on.

### B2R2.MiddleEnd.BinGraph Package?

`B2R2.MiddleEnd.BinGraph` defines basic graph types and values. Our CFG analyses
are dependent on this package.
