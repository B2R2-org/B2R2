/// <summary>
///   Binary apparatus (Apparatus) contains the key components and information
///   about our CFG analysis, such as all the parsed instructions from the
///   target binary as well as the positions of all the leaders found. This will
///   be updated through our CFG analyses.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
///   <para>B2R2's CFG analyses roughly work as follows.</para>
///   <para>
///     In the very first stage, we recursively parse (and lift) binary
///     instructions starting from the given entry point. In this stage, we
///     simply follow concrete edges. Therefore we may miss indirect branches in
///     this stage, but we will handle them later. After parsing the entire
///     binary, we obtain a mapping (InstrMap) from an address to an InsInfo.
///   </para>
///   <para>
///     Next, we recursively traverse every instruction found again as we did in
///     the first stage, but in this stage, we will analyze lifted LowUIR
///     statements to figure out any internal branches (intra-instruction
///     branches). This step is important to gather all possible program points
///     (ProgramPoint), which are a jump target, i.e., a leader. The leader
///     information is stored in the LeaderInfos field.
///   </para>
///   <para>
///     While we compute the leader positions, we mark every call target
///     encountered to build both CallerMap and CalleeMap. Normally, being a
///     call target (i.e., callee) implies being a function entry. However, this
///     is not always the case. We should not always consider a callee as a
///     function. Nevertheless, our lens-based framework can provide a valid CFG
///     at any callee, which can greatly help further analyses.
///   </para>
///   <para>
///     Once Apparatus is constructed, our SCFG module will then build a graph
///     based on the information found in the Apparatus. The details should be
///     found in the SCFG module.
///   </para>
///   <para>
///     Now that we have obtained basic information (Apparatus and SCFG) to work
///     with, we perform some post analyses to improve the information. For
///     example, we remove unnecessary edges from the SCFG by disconnecting
///     return edges from a function that termiates the process (e.g., exit
///     function), and we recover indirect branch targets to discover more
///     instructions. After the post analyses, we may or may not have an updated
///     Apparatus, in which case we rerun the above steps to update our SCFG
///     (with newly found instructions, etc.). We terminate our analysis when
///     our post analayses do not bring a different Apparatus.
