# B2R2.FrontEnd.BinInterface

### B2R2?

B2R2 is a binary analysis and reversing framework written purely in F#. Since it
does not rely on any native (unmanaged) code, it is readily usable in any
platform or OS that .NET runs on.

### B2R2.FrontEnd.BinInterface Package?

`B2R2.FrontEnd.BinInterface` is the main interface for B2R2's front-end. In most
cases, it should suffice to import just this package because all the other
front-end packages will be loaded by this one.
