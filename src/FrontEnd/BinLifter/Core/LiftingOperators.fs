/// This is the special operator that we use for writing a lifter. There are
/// several major operators we use including this one. This one simply appends a
/// statement to the IRBuilder. We always put a IRBuilder variable immediately
/// after each operator without any space to make it visually distinct. For
/// example, for a builder variable "ir", we write a lifting logic as follows:
/// !<ir insAddr insLen
/// !!ir (t1 := v1 .+ v2)
/// !!ir (t2 := t1 .* t1)
/// !>ir insAddr insLen
let inline ( !! ) (ir: IRBuilder) (s) = ir.Append s

/// The special operator for creating a temporary variable.
let inline ( !* ) (ir: IRBuilder) rt = ir.NewTempVar rt

/// The special operator for starting an instruction (ISMark).
let inline ( !< ) (ir: IRBuilder) insLen =
  ir.Append (AST.ismark insLen)

/// The special operator for finishing an instruction (IEMark).
let inline ( !> ) (ir: IRBuilder) (insLen: uint32) =
  ir.Append (AST.iemark insLen)

/// The special operator for applying a function with a IRBuilder as input.
