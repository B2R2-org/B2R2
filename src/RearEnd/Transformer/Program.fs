Usage: b2r2 transformer [-f file|-d file] [action] (-- [action] ...)

Transformer runs a chain of transforming actions (IAction). An action takes in
an object as input and returns another object as output. Any number of actions
can be chained together as long as their types match. Users can define their own
action(s) by implementing the IAction interface.

[Options]

-f <fsx file>  : Load a custom fsx (F# script) file to define custom actions.
-d <dll file>  : Load a dll file defining custom actions.

[Actions]
