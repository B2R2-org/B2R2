B2R2 is the next-generation binary reversing framework that runs
purely on .NET, that is it runs on any platform that .NET supports.
This is the B2R2 launcher, which is a .NET tool that can invoke
various tools provided by our framework. To know more about B2R2,
please visit our official website: https://b2r2.org/.

Usage: dotnet b2r2 [app name]

[Available Applications]

- file (a.k.a. peek, fileview)

  This is a file format reader that is similar to readelf or otool.
  You can read various file format information using this app. To
  learn more about the tool, type the following command:

  $ dotnet b2r2 file --help

- dump (a.k.a. disasm, bindump)

  This is a linear-sweep disassembler similar to objdump, although
  this app is more powerful and versatile. To learn more about the
  tool, type the following command:

  $ dotnet b2r2 dump --help

- explore (a.k.a. binexplorer, analyze)

  This is a recursive-descent disassembler that provides a web-based
  GUI as well as its own CLI terminal. To learn more about the tool,
  type the following command:

  $ dotnet b2r2 explore --help

- repl

  This is a REPL (Read Evaluate Print Loop) for our binary IR as well
  as binary assembly languages. To learn more about the tool type the
  following command:

  $ dotnet b2r2 repl --help

- asm (a.k.a. assembler)

  This is a simple cross-platform assembler. To learn more about the
  tool, type the following command:

  $ dotnet b2r2 asm --help
